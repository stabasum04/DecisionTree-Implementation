# DecisionTree-to-find-out-the-flower-type
This Python project uses a Decision Tree Classifier from the scikit-learn library to classify iris flowers based on user input. The classifier is trained on the famous Iris dataset, which contains features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three types of iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
